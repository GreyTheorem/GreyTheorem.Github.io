    <h1><strong>Market Sizing & Forecasting</h1></strong>
    <p>
      Get Market Sizing & Forecasting customized to your product-use case in the markets that matter most. Forecasting is given via differentiated scenarios to retain relevance through cyclical economic environments. All scenarios are built utilizing the Economic Engine model, mechanistically recombining consumer, environmental, and internal growth drivers for forecasting fidelity. 
Grey Vector Forecasting is a secondary “Calculator” tool allowing user-control of defined variables for relevant short-,mid-,long-term forecasting through changing stakeholder scenarios.

	<h1><strong>Competitive Intelligence</h1></strong>
    <p>
      Know the Who, What, Why, When, Where, How, and How much of competitors. From pricing schemes, hiring patterns, executive dossiers, organizational/operational structure, region strengths, technology and accounting review, HCP and marketing advertising material – get the data that drives decisions. Grey Theorem provides updates on a flexible basis, performs clinic visits for primary consumer experience, attends conferences, and is well versed in patient- and patient-care language enabling next level insights from HCPs. 


    </p>
	<h1><strong>Consumer-Use Surveys</h1></strong>
    <p>
     Consumer-Use Surveys are the keystone of every Market Research Department. Often called an A&U (Awareness & Usage) or CBA (Competitive Business Assessments), these surveys are the primary method to understand how consumers view the competitive field, products and companies. Elevate your insights past the classic KPIs of Overall Satisfaction, Recommendation, and base Utilization – Grey Theorem utilizes product aggregate theme scores and provides customer classification at base. Grey Theorem takes the time in the Design phase to understand how clients and stakeholders use and “digest” data to ensure Questions and Answers align with company directives.

    </p>
	<h1><strong>Pricing Studies</h1></strong>
    <p>
      Classic pricing study methods such as Westendorp, Gabor-Granger, and Conjoint carry merit in specific use-cases, where as mixed methods employed by Grey Theorem provide more context on price affinities. Parallel HCP and consumer pricing studies ensure alignment across the full consumption cycle, while revealing bridges and disconnects between steps. Market expansion investigations are supported with regional consumer spending studies to guide exploratory prices, while embedded customer classification questions let companies focus on their customers.

    </p>
	<h1><strong>Sales Intel Exchange</h1></strong>
    <p>
     Listening is an analytical skill. Internal sales teams are the closest to the customer, while forms and dashboards can provide quantitative data, their lack depth and color can make it difficult to translate into operational strategy. Grey Theorem interviews internal sales teams and verifies with external primaries and secondary research to provides high-definition insights with a Confidence Factor and Root-Cause Analysis to ensure fit for use.
