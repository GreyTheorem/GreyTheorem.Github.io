      Grey Theorem is an independent market research, economics and life sciences advisory firm built upon the logical principles of Grey Systems Theory. Framing every system as a mix of complete knowns, partial knowns, and complete unknowns; all projects are designed and practiced with exploratory questions, robust mathematics, and descriptive framing for deliverables. 

Grey Theorem is owned and operated by Josef Grey, an experienced and awarded inventor, economist, and scientist. Equipped with two decades of successes and informative failures across the Life Sciences vertical, Josef has made advances across disease modeling, assay development, drug discovery, preclinical development, market entry/access, and market research-side services. Historical economics research has focused on modeling developing nation growth, particularly South America. Current academic interests lie in evolution of shadow markets and economies.

The three core values of Grey Theorem are Science, Integrity, and Discipline. Combining mission-priority with creative investigative methods, Grey Theorem prides itself on operating with absolute discretion, privacy, and respect. Professional integrity and reputation is paramount in the age of deepfakes, client double-dipping, and increased distrust in government reporting. As confusion and volatility increase, it’s time for a return to method, it’s time for Grey Theorem.
