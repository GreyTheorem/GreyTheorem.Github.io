    <h1><strong>Economic Enzyme model</h1></strong>
    <p>
      The Economic Enzyme model functions as a framework of forecasted sizes of an economic system or market based on internal mechanisms of economic activity and growth; instead of a singular set of forecasted growth rates, forecasts are made via three scenarios reflecting distinct internal economic activity rates to enable relevant guidance through economic and market volatility. Forecasts are mathematically derived with descriptive analytics on key variables, catalysts, environments, and competitive movements.
