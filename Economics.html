    <h1><strong>Panoramic Economic Analysis</h1></strong>
    <p>
      Expanding on root-cause and PESTLE models, Grey Theorem analyzes an economy through 10 axes studying the economic participant, environment, and governing system. These are further translated to market of interest for potential product fit and entry-points. For market or operational expansion, boots-on-the-ground perspective is available. Understanding the pieces that make up a market, and how they fit together before making strategic decisions is simple math.

	<h1><strong>Forensic Review</h1></strong>
    <p>
Publicly traded companies drive market narratives via public, not transparent, reporting. Losses are hidden in Costs to Sell, language throughout reports are designed to hide true reporting definitions, investments turn into self-payments, and corporate treasury requirements are lax. Meanwhile, the legacy of fake data has propagated in Science, with journal retractions escalating in recent years. Grey Theorem combines analog investigative methods with digital sleuthing to flag concerns.
